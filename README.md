# News Image Generation
This repository contains a script that generates an image based on a news headline. The image is then saved and displayed in this README.
The news headline is fetched from the NewsAPI and the image is generated using the DiffusionPipeline from the `diffusers` Python package. The image generation process is performed on a GPU.
The script runs every few minutes, fetching a new headline and generating a new image each time.
